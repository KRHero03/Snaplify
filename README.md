# Snaplify

## Description 
- The lockdown had a very significant impact on our lives and has proven to grow distances among our friends and families.
- Snaplify provides a Gamified solution to this cause.
- Users can share pictures of their memories with each other in a fun way. All they have to do is to share 4 Pictures relating to a WORD, to their friends and the friends are supposed to guess the WORD using the pictures.
- The core concept is to bring out the past happy memories and reminisce the happy events in users' lives.
- Apart from this, it also provides a healthy competition that motivates users to share more such Snaps and Snap Challenges with their loved ones, which provides more Rewards.
- User Identification is based on Google Accounts.
- The App is made Child Friendly and it is made sure that no one publishes any vulgar images or words with the help of a Flask based Deep Learning model deployed on Heroku.
- And don't worry about the Pictures as they are stored using the MOIBIT decentralized secure storage network which proves to be secured.
- Snaplify also provides seamless User to User chat functionality to exchange chains of thoughts between users.
- All in all, Snaplify also presents itself with an Attractive User Interface.
